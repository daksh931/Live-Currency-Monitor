# Live-Currency-Monitor
I made a Desktop application which shows live price of different currencies. Using Tkinter we shaped our project into a desktop version (easy for user to use). Using APIs in our project continuous and automatically values of currencies are updating in our desktop application. Connecting application to Server for saving ,deleting and display data from server data in GUI (application). APIs - Fetching live Prices of currencies in real time from servers and then extracting only relevant data from servers.
we have collected data and show it in proper way to user in GUI (Graphical user interface) that is very easy to use , program will fetch real time data (Prices of currencies)from server and only required information pass to project and this cycle will automatically gets update after every few seconds. We have added features like Save , Delete so that user can easily perform operations on data and able to see saved data also update to get data from server.
